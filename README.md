# Lingtrame BIBFRAME Application Profile
This repository contains information about the way the [FID Linguistik](https://data.linguistik.de)
uses [BIBFRAME](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/) as well as some extensions. Most importantly, it
contains information about the BIBFRAME application profile – "Lingframe" – which has been defined
to be used in conjunction with the [Lin|gu|is|tik portal](https://linguistik.de)

All content in this repository is to be considered as a snapshot of the work in progress.
